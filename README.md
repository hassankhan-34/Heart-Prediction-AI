This project is a Python-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It features a Flask web application for user interaction, making the system accessible for both technical and non-technical users. The tool helps in early detection of heart-related health risks based on input data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors.
